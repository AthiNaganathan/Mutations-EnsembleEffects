# Mutations-EnsembleEffects
Includes data on protein ensemble properties (coupling free energies) that exhibit an exponential distance dependence on introducing mutations

Execute 'Coupling_AlaMut.m' - line 3 can be modified to choose from among the three proteins studied (CypA, CheY and Pdz). 

Line 4 specifies the residue number whose effect on the ensemble (via alanine substitution) can be observed. The 'mat' files include the differential coupling matrices and incdices which are used to generate the ouputs.

Files_Variables.docx provides information on the various parameters.
